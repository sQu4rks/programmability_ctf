# Stage 3

ACME has been using your script and it works like a charm! 

They want to combine the power of both solutions and Dominik asks you to feed the URL information from Threatgrid back to Umbrella. Now that ACME Corp. has invested more into Cisco Security they are also using SecureX to have a better overview over all the products. Dominik is curious about the capabilities of Threat Response and how it could add to the Workflow for his SOC team. 
They would like to directly inspect a file hash from AMP in SecureX Threat Response and check for sightings in all modules in the solution. Everything that Threat Response finds, should be printed in a readable format and the SHA of the file should be added to a simple custom detections list in AMP through Threat Response to be blocked throughout their whole environment. 
After doing this, a Report should be generated with all findings and actions taken and posted to the Webex Space of the Team. That report should be well formatted so the team can pass it on to the Manager of the IT Department or CIO.
