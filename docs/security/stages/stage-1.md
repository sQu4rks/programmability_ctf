# Stage 1

ACME Corp. wants you to show them Umbrellas capabilites on some URLs. The SOC team leader Dominik asks you to use Umbrellas API capabilities to get the domain status and all historical information about an URL that is available in Umbrella. Once you gathered this information it should be printed out in a readable, report-like format with sanitized URLs.
Any URL that is returned as malicious should be added to a block list through the Umbrella API. He would like you to do that for any URL that would be inserted by the team in any fashion. 

For test purposes you can use `internetbadguys(dot)com`.
