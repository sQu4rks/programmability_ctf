# Stage 2

Dominik really likes the URL checking. ACME Corp. recently purchased AMP after they had a Malware Incident. Dominik asks if you can build a script to check AMP for events on a host from their environment. For testing you should use the client `Demo_AMP_Threat_Audit`. If it returns any events with type `Executed malware`, list the information, isolate the host with AMP and investigate the chosen file hash(es) through Threatgrid. Maybe the sample has been submitted before! Check Threatgrid for the domains that have been seen for the sample and save that information in a file.
