# Hints for Stage 2

??? note "I could use hint 1"

    Have a look at the `verify.py` script. Here we have shown how to connect to ACI and query a endpoint.
    You can find the docs for ACI by logging into the ACI web interface and look for the documentation 
    on the upper right handside.

??? note "I could use hint 2"

    The following example is a REST query to the fabric that returns the health score for a tenant named "3tierapp": https://hostname/api/node/mo/uni/tn-3tierapp.xml?query-target=self&rsp-subtreeinclude=health


??? note "I could use hint 3"

    For hint level 3 please contact your proctor.
