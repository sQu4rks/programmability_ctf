# Stage 3

Lina loves the scripts you have been developing. However, she is used to chat commands and thus would like you to develop a bot that can answer simple query like

* How many meetings do I have scheduled?
* How many spaces am I part of?

For this, you'll have to create a bot and deal with webhooks. While formatted text was nice for the scripts the bot should use the adaptive cards to format the information in a visually more appealing way.

Lina's chief infrastructure engineer Roman, a UC engineer by heart, would also like to see some information extracted from CUCM. He found the AXL API of CUCM. He asks you if you could implement the bot to be able to do a phone lookup directly on CUCM.

(Note: If you need access to a CUCM instance please ask your proctor.)
