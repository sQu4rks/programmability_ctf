# Stage 0

In this stage we are going to get you started on posting messages using the Webex REST API.

Webex has the concept of spaces/rooms and you have been added to a space for this CTF with all other participants of your cohort. Your task in this stage is to: 

* Identify the space with all participants of your team using the name of the space and the API
* Extract the id of that space
* Add that id to the `env.py` file for the `PRODUCTION_ROOM` key of the `config` dictionary.
